	<h1>What is HTML? The Basics <br /> of Hypertext Markup Language <br /> Explained </h1>

	HTML is not a programming language, meaning it doesn’t have the ability to create dynamic functionality. Instead, it makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.<p>
	<h1>The History of HTML</h1>
	<p>HTML was invented by Tim Berners-Lee, a physicist at the CERN research institute in Switzerland. He came up with the idea of an Internet-based hypertext system.</p>
	<p>Hypertext means a text that contains references (links) to other texts that viewers can access immediately. He published the first version of HTML in 1991, consisting of 18 HTML tags. Since then, each new version of the HTML language came with new tags and attributes (tag modifiers) to the markup.</p>
	<p>According to Mozilla Developer Network’s HTML Element Reference, currently, there are 140 HTML tags, although some of them are already obsolete (not supported by modern browsers).</p>
	<p>Due to a quick rise in popularity, HTML is now considered an official web standard. The HTML specifications are maintained and developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). You can check out the latest state of the language anytime on <a href="http://w3schools.com">W3C’s website</a>.</p>
	<h1>How Does HTML Work?</h1>
	<p>HTML documents are files that end with a <i><b>.html</b></i> or <i><b>.htm</b></i> extension. You can view then using any web browser (such as Google Chrome, Safari, or Mozilla Firefox). The browser reads the HTML file and renders its content so that internet users can view it.</p>
	<p>Usually, the average website includes several different HTML pages. For instance: home pages, about pages, contact pages would all have separate HTML documents.</p>
	<p>Each HTML page consists of a set of <i><b>tags</i></b> (also called <i><b>elements</i></b>), which you can refer to as the building blocks of web pages. They create a hierarchy that structures the content into sections, paragraphs, headings, and other content blocks.</p>
